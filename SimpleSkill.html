    <h1>Choosing Wood For Laser Engraving</h1>
    
    <!-- This is my intro -->
    <p>Because there so many different types of wood available, it has become one of the most popular materials to engrave and cut with a laser. There are so many different projects that can be completed with this versatile material. Not only can you engrave it, but you can also cut through most types of wood up to 3/4″. The best wood for laser engraving depends a lot on the project you are planning on doing.</p>

    <!-- Hobby #1 -->
    <p>There are many wood species available for laser engraving, some being more suitable than others. If you are just getting started working with wood, we recommend starting with one of the following: (these woods are easy to work with and produce excellent results!)

        Alder – This wood passes all the tests. It features a light color, has a supple texture, and has minimal streaking. Make Alder your top choice for laser engraving projects.
        Cherry – A blonde cherry wood has a high resin content and is typically light in color. Although it has high levels of streaking, cherry is still an excellent choice for many laser etching projects.
        Maple – This is an excellent wood for engraving photos. It has light streaking, burns dark most of the time, and is light in color.</p>

    <p>
        The most important thing to remember while choosing wood is to pick something that will make your project stand out the most. Avoid dark wood and consider some of the less intuitive properties of wood, like streaking and resin content.
