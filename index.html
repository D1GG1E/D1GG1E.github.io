    <h1>My Air Force life in South Korea</h1>

    <!-- Hobby #1 -->
    <p>My favorite hobby is carpentry. Since I was a young boy, I enjoyed creating things out of wood; Mostly boxes, and cutting boards to give away as gifts. I don't have any of my tools over here with me in Korea, so I have pivoted toward laser engraving as a hobby. This upcoming year will involve a lot of laser engraving trinkets and squadron gear to sell.</p>

    <!-- Hobby #2 -->
    <p>I have been studying Korean for my job for the last 13 years. I'm not sure if it's just the sunken cost fallacy talking, but I actually do enjoy it. I study it for 12-20 hours per month.</p>

    <!-- Hobby #3 -->
    <p>In my daily job, I deliver a lot of briefings. To get better at this, I started doing improvisational comedy while stationed in california. I still like to perform, but we don't have too many opportunities for that in Korea. I have been checking out Toastmasters lately. I think they are pretty swell.</p>
